      Hey!
      I thought you might look here...😊
      If you're wondering, this site was build with React.js and Tailwind CSS. 
      It's deployed with Google Firebase.
      I built all my components and animations from scratch. 
      My favicon is a play off the JavaScript logo (because JS is dope!)
      And my favorite hobbies are playing drums 🥁 and playing flag football 🏈.
      I hope you enjoy your time on my site!
